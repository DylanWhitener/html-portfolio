<h3>Dead Pool</h3>
<p>This movie is one of the funniest movies I have seen. Ryan Renolds is one of my favorite actors. Great action scenes and breaks the forth wall and talks to the audience.</p>
<h3>Kings Men</h3>
<p>Very funny movie, lots of action and Egerton is one of my favorite up and coming actors.</p>
<h3>Shrek</h3>
<p>One of the best annimated films. Eddie Murphy is absolutely hilarious.</p>
